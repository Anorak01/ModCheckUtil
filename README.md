A small utility to generate modlist.txt file for ModCheck Fabric mod.

It is really crude right now, but it works good enough.

---
To create the modlist.txt, execute this utility ```java -jar [utility-jar-name].jar``` in the clients mods directory.

The text file should appear in the same directory.
Copy this file to the root of your server (next to files like server.properties) and ModCheck should find it.
